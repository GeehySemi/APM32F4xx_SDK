&par Example Description

This example describes how to use  ADC1 to monitor the voltage of ADC1_Channel0 continuously.
When input Voltage of ADC1_Channel0(PA0) voltage is lower than 0.62v or higher than 2.27V，LED2 is on,
otherwise, LED2 is off. That is If the voltage on ADC1_Channel0(PA0) is not in the thresholds which is setted brefore,
analog watchdog interrupt will generate and light LED2.
The converted voltage is displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

using ADC1_Channel0(PA0)

The USART1 is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
