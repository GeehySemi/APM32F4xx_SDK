&par Example Description

The example shows how to configure IWDT and feed dog to prevent a system reset.
After IWDT initialization, if press KEY1 to start feed watchdog, System enters into a infinite loop,
feed dog before the counter. reach a given timeout value to prevent system reset and
keep LED2 blinking regulary. Ohterwise System will reset about 4 seconds!
Pressing KEY1 again to stop feed dog will trigger system reset in 4 seconds, when the counter reach a given timeout value. LED3 will be lighted when a system reset is triggered by IWDT.
if system reset   is triggered by IWDT, "IWDT Reset" will be print with USART1.

&par Hardware Description

The USART1 is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
