&par Example Description

This example describes how to use the ADC1 to convert the internal temperature sensor's voltage
applied to the APM32F407 MINI ADC1_Channel16.
And Calculate the temperature according to the formula as follow:
T = (V - 0.7782)/0.0024 + 28;

The converted voltage and temperature are displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

note:
        According to actual test data of multiple bathes of chips, 
        V28 is adopted instead of V25 for this example. And 0.7782v is the voltage for 28℃

&par Hardware Description

The USART1 is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
